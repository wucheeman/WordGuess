Make sure you're working in a copy of this for a homework assignment! 

Requirements
============
[] Use inquirer.js for user input
[] App has file letter.js containing a constructor, Letter.
  () Constructor has no dependencies
  () Constructor displays an alphabetic character or an underscore, depending on whether or not the user has guessed the letter.
  () Constructor defines a string value to store the underlying character for the letter
  () Constructor defines boolean value that stores whether that letter has been guessed yet
  () Constructor defines method that returns the underlying character if the letter has been guessed, or underscore) if not
  () Constructor defines method that takes a character as an argument and checks it against the underlying character, updating the stored boolean value to true if guessed correctly
[] App has file word.js containing a constructor, Word.
  () Constructor depends on letter.js and nothing else
  () Constructor creates an object representing the word the user is to guess. 
  () Constructor defines an array of Letter objects representing the letters of the word
  () Constructor defines a method that returns a string representing the word.
  () This method calls each letter object's method that displays the character or an underscore and concatenates the response.
  () Constructor defines a method that takes a character as an argument and calls the letter object's method for guessing the value on each letter object
[] App has file index.js containing the logic for the course of the game.
  () Logic depends on word.js and nothing else
  () Logic randomly selects a word and uses the `Word` constructor to store it
  () Logic prompts the user for each guess and keeps track of the user's remaining guesses
